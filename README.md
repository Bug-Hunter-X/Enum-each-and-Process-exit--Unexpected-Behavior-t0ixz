This example showcases a subtle issue in Elixir when using `Enum.each` in conjunction with `Process.exit`.  The expectation is that terminating the process from within the `Enum.each` function would halt further iteration, however, it might not behave as expected in all scenarios, resulting in potential data inconsistencies or incomplete operations.  The solution provided demonstrates a more robust approach.
